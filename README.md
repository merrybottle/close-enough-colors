The Undefined Colour, A Melodramatic Story Retold.

It's a normal day, sitting at my dreary office desk.  The dull afternoon is setting in but I'm
alert and ready.  I've been waiting for a week and I can feel it's close.  Any time now.

From the corners of my eyes, a red dot blinked at me.

It's here.
I've got mail.
I open it.

My eyes scanning and skimming... there's the link. Click.

Wow.

The designer has outdone herself.  The new page design has been beautifully crafted. Those
colours!

I start a new .scss file.  This is the best part.

All the noise around me drowns out and I hear nothing but the tappity tap of my own keyboard. All
is well in the world.

But then there it is. I inspect it. My right eyebrow rising slowly... That colour, right there.
That's not in the colour scheme.  'Find all' in project... no, no, it doesn't exist.  Anywhere!

Whipping my head around, my eyes frantically searched for her. I feel a slight shock shiver through
me.  It's now past 5 and the office has nearly emptied out.

Why? Why is this happening to me?

## Why
I know... total drama queen.  But I'm sure this has happened many times to many front end devs out
there.

There is a colour palette which we must stick to, but the design usually has a colour or 2 that
doesn't quite fit. Slightly different shade to the existing set.

I created this in order to find the closest colour in the palette... and the hope for the best in
the QA process.

P.S. you should still talk to your designer about it first.  Sometimes it's not a mistake!
